# NearMeans

NearMeans is a platform for local collaboration through the sharing of the means of production. NearMeans allows makers, fixers, technologists, and DIY folks better access the resources local to them and within their community to accomplish their needs. By enabling local collaboration and exchange of resources, more sustainable practices can be achieved by reducing waste and redundant production.
